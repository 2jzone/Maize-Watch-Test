# Maize-Watch
Maize Watch is a smart agriculture platform that monitors maize farms using sensors (like temperature, moisture, and nutrient levels). It analyzes this data in real-time and gives prescriptive recommendations (e.g., when to irrigate or fertilize) through a mobile app and web dashboard.
